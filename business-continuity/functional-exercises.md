# Business Continuity Functional Exercises

In addition to tabletop exercises, your Service Reliability Team also has obligations related to performing _functional_ exercises. Unlike tabletop exercises, these involve simulating disruptions, and responding to them as though they were real. In other words, you will follow the actual steps of your playbooks and Business Continuity Plan, though in a simulated environment.

To perform a functional business continuity exercise, your Service Reliability Lead should first make a copy of the template below, and link to it from your ISMS.

Next, your Service Reliability Team should pick several assets to test (based on business criticality), and should follow the process to restore/redeploy those assets, as described in the relevant playbooks or in your Business Continuity Plan. Importantly, your Service Reliability Team should time itself during this process.

Finally, your Service Reliability Team should log the results of the functional test in you Business Continuity Testing Log. If it took you longer to restore the asset than the recovery time objective (RTO) of the asset, you should rethink those metrics.
