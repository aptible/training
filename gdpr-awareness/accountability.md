# Accountability Under the GDPR

Another principle mentioned elsewhere in the GDPR is the Accountability Principle. This principle requires that we ensure our compliance with the GDPR and document our purposes for processing data.

In short, the Accountability Principle requires that we comply with the GDPR and that we can _demonstrate_ our compliance with the GDPR. To satisfy this principle, we do the following:

*   Approve policies and procedures (in your organization's ISMS) related to GDPR activities
*   Maintain a Data Use Inventory that describes our processing activities (and our lawful bases)
*   Ensure that we have the right contracts in place with our vendors
*   Log (and report) security and privacy incidents (including data breaches)
*   Complete data protection impact assessments when our processing activities warrant them (more on this later)
*   Log and track requests to exercise rights from data subjects, as well as the actions we took in response

In other words, the Accountability Principle is focused on all the ways we document our compliance with the GDPR. As you review the next slides, think about how your organization might evidence its compliance with the GDPRâ€™s required activities.
