# Conclusion

Thanks for completing GDPR Awareness for Workforce Training!

We covered a lot of topics today, including:

*   The history of data protection in Europe
*   The scope of the GDPR
*   The GDPR’s Data Processing Principles
*   How we document our compliance with the GDPR
*   The rights data subjects have, and how we respond to exercises of them
*   How we analyze the risk of new processing activities (through the use of Data Protection Impact Assessments)
*   The special rules related to direct marketing and cookies
*   The requirements related to international data transfers
*   What GDPR enforcement looks like

While this is a lot of content, understanding and complying with the GDPR and the rest of your organization’s ISMS is very important.
