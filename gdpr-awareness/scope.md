# The Scope of the GDPR

The GDPR’s scope is expansive, which means that it often applies to organizations not based in the EU. An organization that is within both the material scope and the territorial scope of the GDPR will be subject to the GDPR.

Article 2 of the GDPR defines the **material scope** of the GDPR, which specifies the **activities** that the GDPR applies to. This includes the automated processing of personal data _and_ the manual processing of personal data when that data is “part of a file system” (essentially including all kinds of electronically stored data). This is broad--it generally applies to most activities (unless carved out by an explicit exception, which usually won’t apply to your organization).

Article 3 of the GDPR defines the **territorial scope** of the GDPR, which specifies the **organizations** that are subject to the GDPR. Under Article 3, the GDPR applies to organizations based in the EU as well as those not based in the EU but that engage in certain activities in the EU. This includes non-EU organizations that sell goods or services to people in the EU, as well as non-EU organizations that monitor the behavior of people in the EU (via things like cookies).

If an organization is within the material and territorial scope of the GDPR, then it is subject to all of the GDPR's requirements.
