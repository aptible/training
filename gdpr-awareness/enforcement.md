# Enforcement

Failure to comply with the GDPR can result in severe reputational and financial consequences.

A GDPR violation could result in a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of your organization’s annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. Enforcement is conducted by national authorities called Data Protection Authorities (“DPAs”), and enforcement actions can begin when the privacy rights of a data subject have been violated or when an organization operates within their jurisdiction.
