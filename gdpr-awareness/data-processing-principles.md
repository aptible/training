# Data Processing Principles

Now that we have covered the terminology let’s discuss the high level principles the GDPR imposes on organizations as to the processing of personal data.

Article 5 of the GDPR requires organizations to comply with six principles to protect personal data. In other words, whenever your organization processes personal data, we should make sure that the following principles are met.

*   **Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:** We should only collect and process personal data when we (1) have a lawful basis for doing so, and (2) clearly communicate the nature of the processing to data subjects.
*   **Purpose minimization:** We should (1) only collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; and (2) limit our processing to reflect those purposes. For example, if we collect an email address to send an order receipt, we shouldn’t automatically sign the data subject up for our newsletters.
*   **Data minimization:** We should make sure that the personal data we collect is adequate for our needs, relevant to our purpose, and limited to our purpose. For example, we shouldn’t collect Social Security Numbers if our purpose is just to send marketing emails.
*   **Accuracy:** We should take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data we have is not incorrect.
*   **Storage limitation:** We should only store personal data for as long as we need it.
*   **Integrity and confidentiality:** We should have security measures in place to protect the security of the personal data we have.

Being mindful of these principles in your work will help your organization protect personal data.
