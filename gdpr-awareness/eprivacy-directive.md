# The ePrivacy Directive, Direct Marketing, and Cookies

When it comes to direct marketing and cookies, thereâ€™s actually a separate European law that we have to ensure compliance with: the ePrivacy Directive.

The ePrivacy directive governs electronic communications and, among other things, requires that your organization obtain **consent** from data subjects prior to setting cookies on their devices and prior to sending them marketing communications through digital channels (such as email, fax, phone, or SMS).

The rules around cookies and digital marketing in the EU are complex and vary among the different countries. But again, the most important thing to remember is that before you engage in these things, we must receive **consent** from the data subjects. If you have questions about how your organization collects consent before engaging in these activities, please consult with your Privacy Officer.
