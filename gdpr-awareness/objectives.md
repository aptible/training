# Objectives

By the end of this training, you will understand:

1.  What the GDPR is and why GDPR compliance is important
2.  How the GDPR affects your day-to-day work (including the specific steps we have to take to comply with the GDPR)
3.  What to do if you receive a data-subject request (including, for example, requests to access data and requests to delete data)
4.  What to do (and whom to go to) if you’re not sure what the GDPR requires

Even if you don’t work with sensitive or personal data, the scope of your work likely falls within your organization’s ISMS and the scope of the GDPR. Thus, our main goal for this training is that you understand the GDPR’s requirements and how your organization satisfies them.
