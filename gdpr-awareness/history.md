# The History of Data Protection in Europe

Before we dive into the specifics of the GDPR, it’s useful to briefly review the history of data protection--and privacy--in the EU. The GDPR is the culmination of over 70 years of Europe’s efforts to protect personal privacy and establish an economic union supporting the free flow of data.

The European Union’s protection of personal privacy as a human right goes back to the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, and the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), applied in 1953, both of which explicitly included privacy as a right.

Since the mid-1950s, there have been a string of laws and regulations that included (to some extent) data privacy, including OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (1980), the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (open for signature in 1981), the EU’s Data Protection Directive (1995), the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2000), and the Treaty of Lisbon (2009).

In light of technological advancements that were outpacing established law, as well as the need for harmonization of data-privacy requirements across Europe, the GDPR was introduced in 2012\. It entered into force in 2016 and became fully enforceable in May 2018\. (Remember all those emails about updated privacy notices and all the new cookie-consent forms on websites? You can thank the GDPR for those!)
