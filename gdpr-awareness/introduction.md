GDPR Awareness for Workforce

Hi and welcome to Aptible's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") awareness training! This training is designed to give you a basic working knowledge of the GDPR and what you need to know about it to do your job.

Your organization has chosen to pursue and maintain compliance with the European Union’s GDPR because that allows your organization to (1) pursue business opportunities in Europe, and (2) hire and retain residents of the European Union.

Because we are subject to the GDPR, we are required to implement a training program that covers the GDPR and how to comply with it. And as you've probably figured out by now, we use Aptible Comply to design, deliver, and audit this training.

This course provides an overview of the key components of the GDPR as well as how your organization has designed processes in its information security management system (“ISMS”) to satisfy them.
