# What is the GDPR?

So what is the GDPR and how does it impact me?

At a high level, the GDPR is the EU’s law governing the collection, use, storage, and transmission of the **personal data of people in the EU**. The GDPR has two overarching goals: (1) protecting people’s personal information, and (2) enabling the free movement of data across the EU by imposing a uniform standard for handling data.

To achieve those goals, the GDPR imposes a number of requirements on your organization, which are described in later slides. In short, it requires your organization to design systems with privacy in mind, protect personal data, and respond to data subjects when they exercise any of a number of rights related to their data.
