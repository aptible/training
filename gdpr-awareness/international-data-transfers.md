# International Data Transfers

One final thing to keep in mind is the GDPR’s rules around international data transfers.

As you now know, the EU uses the GDPR to impose a number of requirements on organizations related to how they collect, process, store, and transmit personal data. But what about countries that don’t have the same kinds of protections for personal data? Can we just take data to another country and do whatever we want with it?

The GDPR is way ahead of you--under the GDPR, your organization may only transfer data out of the EU if that transfer meets certain conditions of the GDPR. Specifically, international transfers outside of the EU are permissible only if they are made in one of the ways defined in the GDPR. (This is the case even if the transfer is just from the EU to a U.S.-based vendor, like AWS, G Suite, or Aptible.)

These permissible avenues include transfers that are made to organizations in a country that the EU has deemed safe (for data privacy) and transfers made pursuant to a contract that includes specific language related to data protection.

The upshot is that if you think you are going to transfer data from the EU to another country (including the U.S.), you should first consult with your Privacy Officer to ensure that your organization is transferring the data in an appropriate way.
