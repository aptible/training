# Responding to Data Subject Requests

Sometimes, your organization will receive a communication from a data subject who is attempting to exercise one of his or her rights. This might be an email that says, “ERASE ALL MY DATA NOW!” or “Please send me a copy of all the information you have about me.” If you get something like that, you should know the next steps to take.

But don’t fret, your responsibility is simple: Make sure your organization's Privacy Officer is aware of the request as soon as possible.

Keep in mind: as a general matter, your organization must respond to all requests within **one month**. So again, if you see a request come in and no one has acted, please don’t hesitate to let your Privacy Officer know.
