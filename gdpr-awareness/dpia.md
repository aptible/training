# Data Protection Impact Assessments

One unique feature of the GDPR is that in some cases, organizations must perform a special kind of risk assessment before they begin processing data in new ways. These are called “data protection impact assessments” or “DPIAs.”

DPIAs are required when a new processing activity is “likely to result in a high risk to individuals.” Vague, right? The GDPR (and related guidance) provides some clarity around this concept--DPIAs are required when a processing activity could have a widespread or serious impact on people. Examples include the following:

*   systematic and extensive profiling that could have significant effects on individuals
*   the processing of special categories of data (like health information)
*   the processing of personal data that could result in a risk of physical harm to individuals as a result of a data breach

When your organization is going to start a new processing activity, the first question that should be answered is whether it needs to perform a DPIA. If so, there are specific steps that your organization will need to take. These are briefly outlined below, but the most important takeaway is: **if you know that your organization is going to do something new with data, check in with your Privacy Officer to make sure a DPIA is completed if needed.**

To complete a DPIA, your Privacy Officer will work with other relevant team members to do the following:

1.  Review the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing activity (and log them)
2.  Determine whether we need to consult with the relevant data subjects or a Data Protection Authority
3.  Analyze the necessity and proportionality of the processing activity to ensure that we have a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for the processing
4.  Analyze and manage the risks to the rights and freedoms of the affected data subjects--in other words, make sure we are mitigating the risks we identified to the data subjects

By following these steps, your organization is ensuring that it is minimizing the risks to data subjects and their data. Ultimately, we want to make sure that we are always considering how our actions might impact the privacy of our data subjects.
