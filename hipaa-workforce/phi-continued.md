# PII + health data = PHI

PHI is a mashup of two kinds of data: individually identifiable data + health data = any data concerning health, health care, or payment for health care. Past, present, or future.

This is pretty clear when the health data is medical in nature. What about when the health data is contextual? For example, a picture of a face on the wall in a doctor's office:

What about a photo in a medical file, without a face? What if the photo contains a unique tattoo or other potentially identifying data?

It’s also sometimes shocking how easily data can be identified.

In the context of your organization, identifiers alone may be PHI (such as a patient email address).

There are circumstances where PHI can be de-identified, but always ask first.

**When in doubt, ask your Security Officer.**
