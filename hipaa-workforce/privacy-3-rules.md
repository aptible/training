# Privacy - 3 Simple Rules

There’s a lot to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but how it affects our day-to-day work at your organization is fairly straightforward. At the risk of sounding like a listicle, we’ll cover three easy rules for PHI privacy at your organization:

1.  We only access, use, or disclose PHI for business purposes, to do our jobs. We only touch PHI for work, ever.
2.  When we do work with PHI, we try to limit our uses or disclosures to the minimum amount of necessary of PHI needed to do our job at that moment.
3.  We are really, really careful where we put PHI. We have special handling rules for the cloud, laptops and workstations, and removable media.
