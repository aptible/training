# Covered Entities: Uses and Disclosures

Basic Rule: A covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose PHI except as provided by HIPAA.

Required disclosures:

*   To the patient, when requested
*   To HHS, for investigation or enforcement

Prohibited uses disclosures:

*   Using genetic information for underwriting health insurance
*   Selling PHI, unless explicitly authorized

The requirements that apply to your organization are dependent on whether you are a covered entity or a business associate. Largely, the HIPAA Privacy Rules apply to covered entities who are responsible for the relationship with the patients.
