# Privacy

Ok, HIPAA regulates the privacy of individually identifiable health information. So let’s talk about privacy.

What is privacy? What does it mean for information to be private? It’s not total secrecy. It’s more that only certain people are allowed to know something.

There are things about each one of us that only we know - literally not another soul in the world knows. There are things you don’t tell your parents, things you’d rather not share with grandma. There may be personal things you don’t want your boss to know about you (and things you’d rather not know about them…)

The HIPAA Privacy Rule puts limits on how we can use PHI internally at your organization, and restricts when we can share it with other parties, such as our cloud computing vendors.
