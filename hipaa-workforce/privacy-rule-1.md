### Never access, use, or disclose PHI for any reason other than that you’re strictly doing your job at your organization.

### Never access PHI because you’re curious, bored, or for any other non-work reason.

### Never share PHI with anyone, even orally in person, over the phone, etc. unless it’s for work. This includes conversations with co-workers, gossip, etc.

_Disclaimer: Everything is audited - all systems that handle PHI are required to have logs._

We’ll talk about your organization's workforce sanctions and HIPAA breach reporting later in this training, but for now just be aware that using or disclosing PHI for unauthorized purposes can land both you and your organization in serious trouble.

**When in doubt, ask your Security Officer.**

If you’re curious, HHS has published a great summary of the Privacy Rule [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html). That said, don’t make any decisions on your own, ask your Privacy Officer or your Security Officer.
