# Objectives

By the end of this training, you will understand:

1.  What HIPAA is
2.  How HIPAA affects how you do your job
3.  What security and privacy controls you are responsible for
4.  When and how to report potential security or privacy incidents

Our main goal for this training is for you to understand what HIPAA means for how you do your job at your organization. We’ll cover the basics about HIPAA but really focus on what it means for us, practically speaking.

Even if you don’t work with HIPAA protected health information normally, it’s important that you be familiar with the rules in case of a security incident.
