# Rule #3: We are Really Careful When Handling PHI

HIPAA puts restrictions on how and when your organization can disclose PHI to third parties, such as our cloud computing vendors. HIPAA requires that we have special contracts in place (usually called “business associate agreements,” or BAAs) with entities that we disclose PHI to.

Be **very careful** when handling PHI. Make sure it is only created, received, maintained/stored, and transmitted to/from approved services.

Your Privacy Officer and your Security Officer maintain a list of approved services.

Never allow PHI to be stored in or pass through a system that is not approved. This includes both systems that your organization builds, develops, and maintains, but also any SaaS or cloud tool we use.

It does not matter if the PHI is encrypted. Encrypted PHI is still PHI, and is still subject to the HIPAA requirement to get a BAA first.

Again, your supervisor or other management will provide you with procedures and guidelines for handling PHI in routines cases, such as customer support, business intelligence research, etc.

If you want to use PHI in a system that is not yet approved, ask your Privacy Officer or your Security Officer first.
