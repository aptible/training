# Sanctions

HIPAA requires that your organization have an official sanction policy in place for workforce members that fail to comply with your organization's privacy or security policies.

Those sanctions can include redoing this training, additional training, reassignment, dismissal/firing for cause, and referral to law enforcement (if needed).

This includes the duty to report. If you fail to report a privacy or security incident, you may be subject to sanctions for that failure, even if you did not cause the original incident.

Please ask your Security Officer if you have any questions about this.
