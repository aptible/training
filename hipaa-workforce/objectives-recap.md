# Objectives Recap

We Covered:

1.  What HIPAA is
2.  How HIPAA affects how you do your job
3.  What security and privacy controls you are responsible for helping implement
4.  When and how to report potential security or privacy incidents

To recap everything we talked about:

1.  HIPAA is a federal law that protects the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, or PHI
2.  We only use PHI for approved work purposes, and only the minimum amount needed to do our job. Weâ€™re very careful to put PHI only in approved systems and services.
3.  We have additional security training. Complete it and ask questions about concepts that are unclear.
4.  Report potential security or privacy incidents immediately to your Security Officer. If they are not available, report it to your Privacy Officer, your supervisor, or the most senior member of your organization's management you find.
