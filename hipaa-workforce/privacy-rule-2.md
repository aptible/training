# Rule #2: We only Use or Disclose the Minimum Necessary PHI

In addition to restricting when and why we can use PHI, HIPAA also restricts how much PHI we use, when we do.

The basic rule is to only use or disclose the minimum amount of PHI necessary to do your job at the moment. There are some cases where this doesn’t apply, but in general assume it applies all the time unless specifically told otherwise by your Privacy Officer or a supervisor.

For example:

*   If you need to transfer some patient data from one system to another, only transfer as many records as you need, or only the portions of the records you need.
*   If you are helping design a new internal report with PHI, only include columns/field that are strictly necessary.
*   If you’re talking with a colleague about a patient (for work purposes, of course), limit the conversation to just the PHI needed.

If your job involves routinely using PHI internally at your organization or disclosing it to third parties, your supervisor or other management will provide you with procedures and guidelines for how much PHI to use in common cases.

If you ever run into a case where you need to use or disclose PHI in a non-routine way, ask your Privacy Officer first.

> #### Minimum Necessary Requirement
> The minimum necessary standard, a key protection of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, is derived from confidentiality codes and practices in common use today. It is based on sound current practice that protected health information should not be used or disclosed when it is not necessary to satisfy a particular purpose or carry out a function. The minimum necessary standard requires covered entities to evaluate their practices and enhance safeguards as needed to limit unnecessary or inappropriate access to and disclosure of protected health information. The Privacy Rule’s requirements for minimum necessary are designed to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the various circumstances of any covered entity.
