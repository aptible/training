# Mandatory Reporting

Ok, to recap:

For HIPAA Privacy, we only use PHI for work purposes, we only use or disclose the minimum necessary amount of PHI needed to do our job, and we are extremely careful about where we put PHI.

For HIPAA Security, your organization has established security policies and guidelines that you will receive training on. Obey the rules and ask questions if you are unsure.

This bring us to the master rule, the rule to rule them all: HIPAA requires that we have a mandatory reporting policy for actual or potential security and privacy incidents.

This means if you even suspect that one of your organization’s privacy or security policies has been violated, you must report it immediately to your Security Officer. If they are not available, report it to your Privacy Officer, your supervisor, or the most senior member of your organization's management you can get in contact with.

Your reporting will set off a structured process of investigation and resolution that follows the HIPAA rules for incidents.

### Never try to fix the problem on your own.

### Never delete or erase data, or reset a system, to try to fix a problem.

### DON’T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT TELL THE SECURITY OFFICER
