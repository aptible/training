# Security Rule #1: Obey

As part of this Aptible Gridiron training, you will also receive training on security awareness and rules for security of electronic data, including PHI, at your organization.

It is really important that you obey these rules at all times. They cover topics like access controls, encryption, incident response, how to handle PHI and other sensitive data securely.

### Never try to circumvent or disable security controls, even if you are just testing. Never try to exceed your access permissions.

### Never use a shared account to access PHI. Don’t share your account, and don’t use anyone else’s. Any service that handles PHI is audited and reviewed.
