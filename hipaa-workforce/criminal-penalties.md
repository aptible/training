“Knowingly” requires only proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense, not that the facts were illegal. For example, if you sold PHI illegally to a third party, your knowledge of the sale is enough to satisfy the knowledge requirement. Claiming that you did not know it was PHI, or did not understand the rules, is not a defense. It is your responsibility to know the rules at your organization.
