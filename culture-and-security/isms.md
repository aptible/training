How do you establish control over data?

The first step is getting organized. If you’ve been processing sensitive data and it’s all over the place in your company, you map out all of your data and assets, to get a sense of the scope of the project before you.

Step two is a kind of containment strategy. Some security frameworks call it a “data minimization” technique: You work to get the scope of sensitive data down to just the necessary components. Shrink your surface area, the number of possible ways you might experience a consequential privacy or security incident. Perhaps even delete data from systems where you don’t need it.

Step three is to secure what’s left, the core of your sensitive data processing business processes and architecture. This is the $64,000 question. When you get good at this, you get feedback about how you’re doing in regards to security. Metrics and things that you can measure and take action on. This is what gives you the power to answer those questions.
