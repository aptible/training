# What is an ISMS?

“Information security management system” comes from ISO 27001, but is used commonly when businesses build privacy and security management programs.

A good ISMS, which is to say, “a good privacy and security management program,” helps you establish control over data.

Like someone learning to ski or snowboard for the first time, you have to learn how to build up and use certain muscles. For your business and your team, those muscles are various controls, which can be technical (like encryption) or organizational (like training).
