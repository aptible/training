# ISMS parameters = ƒ(Requirements • Risk)

Think of the ISMS as a tool to manage requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) and risk together. You have a mix of requirements and decisions that you make based on risk. Both are inputs to the ISMS, and the output is how you run your business.
