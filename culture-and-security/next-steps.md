# Next Steps

Exercise oversight - your ISMS requires that you supervise your employees and report issues to your Security Officer or Privacy Officer. The whole system fails unless you buy in.

Find ways to get feedback. Do your employees think you are good custodians of sensitive data? If not, why?

Praise your team when they report potential incidents, even if there was no problem.

Security and privacy are emergent properties of complex systems, like your organization. Good security and privacy are organic to an organization, cooked in to how you operate. Teams only do what they are told.
