You can change these up, make them more specific or less specific. There’s a formal risk assessment and management process that you’ll use as an organization, but the basic idea is that you can articulate every valid security decision in terms of some bad thing that we anticipate might happen.

This leads to prioritizing controls for risks that have both high impact and high likelihood of happening, etc.
