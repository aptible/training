Do you include security/privacy in performance reviews? Should you? How?

Are security and privacy someone elseâ€™s specific job title, or does everyone feel like they are responsible for security and privacy? How would you know?

How often do you praise in public for talking/thinking about security and privacy?

How often do you praise in public for knowledge and learning about risk, articulating risk?
