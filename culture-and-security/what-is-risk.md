# What is a Risk?

This may seem like a dumb question, but what is a risk? How would you explain to a five-year-old what risk is?

A risk is just a situation where something you care about is put in harmâ€™s way.

We deal with all kinds of risks every day: business risks (is our marketing strategy right?), legal risks (will we get sued?), personnel risks (are we recruiting the right way?). And obviously privacy and security risks when you process sensitive data, like personally identifiable information.

Being able to talk fluently about risk will be an incredibly useful tool for you, as part of management.
