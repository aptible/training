# Objectives

By the end of this training, you will have a better understanding of:

*   What it means to have a security culture, and how it helps us
*   High-risk threats that affect us
*   What you need to be aware of to practice good security day-to-day
*   When and how to report potential security incidents

Our main goal for this training is for you to understand what every single person who works at your organization needs to know about security. We’ll focus on practical information and things you can apply every day at work.

Even if you don’t work with sensitive data normally, it’s important that you be familiar with the rules in case we have a potential or actual security incident, so you can report it.
