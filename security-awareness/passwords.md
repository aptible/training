# Let's talk about passwords

Let’s talk about passwords. Actually let’s talk about all of the accounts and services and data that we work with. Especially ones that are connected to the Internet.

Losing control over those accounts can really suck. Many of these accounts are protected totally or in part by a password.

Passwords are tricky: they only work if they are secret. Passwords that are stolen, or that are easy to guess, either by a human or a machine, are security risks. Some huge breaches have happened because a login was admin/admin:


> #### Equifax used the word 'admin' for the login and password of a database
> After some guesswork, cyber information security firm Hold Security found personal employee information including names, emails, and Social Security equivalents.

What are some of the other ways passwords get stolen, leaked, or guessed? And what can we do to prevent those things from happening to us at your organization?
