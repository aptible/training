# Risk

The Internet can be a risky and chaotic place. Bad things happen to good teams all the time, with security and privacy incidents making the news constantly. How can we make sure that doesnâ€™t happen to us?

Most of the time we don't know when a specific bad event may occur (being targeted by an adversary, disasters, etc.), but we know generally the level of impact that specific bad things would have, and roughly how often they happen to organizations like yours.

In other words, we model risk as a function of likelihood and impact.

In general, we think about impact of a potential future data security incident along four dimensions:

*   **Confidentiality**: What impact would result if data is accessed or used by unauthorized parties?
*   **Integrity**: What impact would result if data were corrupted, forged, or subject to repudiation?
*   **Availability**: What impact would result from downtime, denial of service, or data loss?
*   **Privacy**: What impact would result from data misuse, including by authorized parties?

How can we estimate likelihood?
