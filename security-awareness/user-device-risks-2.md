# User Device Risks

Threats:

*   Lost or stolen device
*   Malware/spyware/ransomware

Assets:

*   Files stored on the machine
*   Files stored in cloud services connected to the machine (Drive, Box, Dropbox, etc.)
*   Keystrokes (passwords, credentials, etc.)

The risk is that if a machine or device is compromised, anything on the machine is compromised, including files, connected services, and keystrokes. We are primarily concerned with preventing data misuse, but if an adversary gets malware on your machine, they can also spy on you, or force your computer to participate in botnets.

**If you lose a laptop or other device, or suspect you either have or have been targeted by malware, tell your Security Officer immediately.**
