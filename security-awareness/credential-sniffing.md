# Credential Stuffing

One way a password can get guessed is if you use the same password in more than one site.

### Never reuse passwords. Never have the same username/password for two sites if you care about either site.

Reusing passwords is bad because it makes the security of the password equivalent to the security of the weakest or unluckiest site you use it with.

“Credential stuffing” is a type of attack where the attacker takes credential pairs (usernames + passwords) from other sites that have been breached, and tries to check if they work in a different site.

For example, in 2014, JP Morgan had a corporate charity program where employees run races. The race registration vendor was hacked. JP Morgan employees used the same passwords for the race vendor as they did at work with live systems. Whoops:

Other large breaches have been associated with credential stuffing:

Troy Hunt runs “Have I been pwned?”, a site for exploring data breaches:

Troy also analyzes password breaches and discusses them on his blog:

> #### What do Sony and Yahoo! have in common? Passwords!
> Another week, another breach. This time Yahoo! was the target with 453,491 email addresses and passwords from their Voices service being exposed for all to see. Whilst unfortunate for those involved, these breaches do give us some unique insight into password practices and as is usually the case, it’s not pretty.
