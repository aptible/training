# Workforce Security Awareness

Hi, welcome to your organization's security awareness training! This training is designed to give you a basic working knowledge of what you need to know about security to do your job. This training is supplemented with training for specific security management frameworks (like HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, and ISO 27001).

We use Aptibleâ€™s Gridiron platform to design, deliver, and audit this training.
