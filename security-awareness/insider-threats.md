# Insider Threats

Although outsiders cause most cyberbreaches, you should also be aware of the real risk of a security or privacy incident being caused by an insider at your organization.

When we talk about "insider threats," what we mean is the threat that an insider at an organization uses his or her access to company information in a way that harms the organization. Importantly, this doesn't necessarily mean that the insider is a malicious actor--insider threats include both knowing _and unknowing_ misuses of access. In other words, someone can constitute an insider threat without even being aware of it.

In general, it's difficult to determine if an insider is using his or her access to your organization's data in an improper way. But there are some signs that you might have a colleague who is a threat to your organization's data, including that the colleague has attempted to gain access to information that is not required to perform his or her job function, has unexplained access to your organization's financial resources, or has committed other violations of your organization's information security policies or procedures.

If you have concerns about a potential or actual insider threat, you should immediately talk to your security officer.
