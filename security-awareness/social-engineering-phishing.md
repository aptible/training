This is an example of a good phishing email. Phishing is one of the most prevalent social engineering scams around.

It’s called “spear phishing” when the attack is targeted at a high-value target.

The spear phishing email shown above was discussed in the NY Times’ expose on how Russian hackers attacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016:
