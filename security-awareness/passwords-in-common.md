(Aside from that they were common to the Sony and Yahoo breaches, as mentioned in the previous Troy Hunt blog post.)

Passwords donâ€™t work well if they can be guessed easily, which includes if the password consists entirely or mostly of phrases that can be Googled. In fact Google publishes a data set of what terms get googled, and how often: [https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T13](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T13)

So passwords that contain concepts like quotes, sports teams, celebrity names, etc. are really bad choices. Passwords like the ones above can be broken in a few milliseconds.

How can you create passwords that are strong and hard to guess (for both humans and computers), but that you can still remember?
