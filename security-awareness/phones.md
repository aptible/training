# What about phones?

Smartphones are basically just computers, and have many of the same risks. Remember, if an attacker gets access to your unlocked phone, they probably have access to your email, messaging/Slack, 2-factor auth apps, and more.

**If you lose a phone, tell your Security Officer immediately.**
