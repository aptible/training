# Objectives

Today we covered:

1.  How we think about risk, and why security matters for everyone
2.  High-risk threats that affect us, like phishing, social engineering, and malware
3.  How to practice good security day-to-day, such as protecting online accounts and credentials; protecting laptops, phones, and devices; and safe browsing
4.  Mandatory reporting of potential security incidents to the Security Officer, immediately

Our main goal for this training was for you to get a basic understanding of your organization’s security goals and the various risks that we face. Hopefully you learned some practical ways you can apply every day at work.

Even if you don’t work with sensitive data normally, it’s important that you be familiar with the rules in case we have a potential or actual security incident, so you can report it.

### Again, if you have any questions about any of this, ask your Security Officer.
