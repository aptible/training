# Personal Use and BYOD

Your organization has a Technology Acceptable Use Policy that permits some incidental use of your organization's assets for personal use. Even if you bring your own device, you’ll still need to comply with that policy.

### Be aware that in the event of a security incident or breach, your organization’s investigation may include the need to run forensics on your devices (laptops, phones) and online accounts.

This could be potentially embarrassing for you, so please, like the old Offspring song, keep ‘em separated.
