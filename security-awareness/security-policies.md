# Security Policies

Your organization has formal information security policies that cover the areas, and that you need to be aware of. You can access these policies in Aptible Gridiron, under My Gridiron Status.

In particular, be aware of the following:

*   **Data Classification Policy**: We bucket data into classification levels. Sensitive or regulated data, like PII, gets classified as “Sensitive/Regulated.”
*   **Secure Information Handling Policy**: We handle information differently depending on the classification level, so sensitive data is treated more carefully.
*   **Technology Acceptable Use Policy**: Essentially, use work resources for work purposes. Don’t circumvent or disable security controls, ever.
*   **Mobile Device Security Policy**: Rules and standards for laptops, workstations, and phones.
*   **Remote Access Policy**: Rules and standards for connecting to your organization's systems remotely.

If you have any questions, ask your Security Officer.
