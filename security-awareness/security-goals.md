# Security Goals

There are a few big-picture goals we have for security at your organization:

1.  Comply with applicable laws and regulations at all times
2.  Protect your organization's data from threats
3.  Avoid breaches of customer data
4.  Build a reputation for trust

Ultimately, it really is important that we, as a team of people working together, be able to protect the data we are entrusted with.
