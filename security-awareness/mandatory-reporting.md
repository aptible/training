# Mandatory Reporting

Your organization has a mandatory reporting policy for actual or potential security and privacy incidents.

This means if you even suspect that one of your organizationâ€™s privacy or security policies has been violated, you must report it immediately to your Security Officer. If they are not available, report it to your Privacy Officer, your supervisor, or the most senior member of management you can get in contact with.

Your report will set off a structured process of investigation and resolution.

### Never try to resolve a suspected security incident on your own. If you have any questions, ask your Security Officer.
