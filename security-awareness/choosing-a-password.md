# How to choose and store strong passwords:

*   Never reuse passwords
*   Make your passwords as long as possible
*   Use a password manager to generate and store passwords
*   If you must write down a password to remember it, destroy the written copy or lock it in a secure place

That’s a bit of a trick question: The best option is to not try to remember all of your passwords. Use a password manager like 1Password or LastPass to store passwords. Use the secure passphrase generator feature to generate long passwords with lots of randomness.

Even if you do that, however, there are still some passwords you will have to remember (such as the password to get into your password manager, your laptop OS password, SSH passphrases, etc.)

For those passwords, make a passphrase. The simple version can be a sentence that has meaning to you. Remember, the longer the better and don’t use quotes or anything that can be Googled.

> IT’S GETTING EASIER to secure your digital privacy. iPhones now encrypt a great deal of personal information; hard drives on Mac and Windows 8.1 computers are now automatically locked down; even Facebook, which made a fortune on open sharing, is providing end-to-end encryption in the chat tool WhatsApp. But none of this technology offers as much protection as you may think if you don’t know how to come up with a good passphrase.
