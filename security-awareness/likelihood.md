There is a ton of value in hard-won experience, but ideally we would like to learn from other’s mistakes in security. So we put a lot of emphasis on paying attention to security issues that affect organizations like yours, organizations that handle similar kinds of data or use similar tools.

If a certain risk or threat to data has happened to others, we want to be aware of it and avoid becoming the next news story, or incurring some other adverse impact for your organization.

We also prepare for the worst by designating a formal incident response team, and conducting extra incident response training and testing.
